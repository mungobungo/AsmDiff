1. Intro

Library for calculating diffs between .Net assemblies in different folders.


2. Example 

For example, you have assembly called CoolLibrary.dll
Actually, you have two copies of it. Located in folders "first" and "second"
So you launch asmdiff in console and can see the difference.

$ asmdiff first second
CoolLibrary.dll
CoolLibrary, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null
        Int32 Test.Sample(x:String)
        IL_0000: nop,IL_0001: ldc.i4.s 66,IL_0003: stloc.0,IL_0004: br.s IL_0006
,IL_0006: ldloc.0,IL_0007: ret

CoolLibrary.dll
CoolLibrary, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null
        Int32 Test.Sample(x:String)
        IL_0000: nop,IL_0001: ldc.i4.s 33,IL_0003: stloc.0,IL_0004: br.s IL_0006
,IL_0006: ldloc.0,IL_0007: ret


It's easy to see that  int Test.Sample(sting x) method has changed.

3. Is there compiled version?
Yeah, you can find it in "examples" folder.
go there and run "AsmDiff first second"
